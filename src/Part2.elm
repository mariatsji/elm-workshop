type alias Circle =
    { area : Float }



{--
Given a Circle type with an area, return the radius of the circle.
The area is in cm^2 and the radius is in cm.

You can find out how to access a field from the Circle record here :
http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax#records

Try to use a let / in expression, which you can read about here :
http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax#let-expressions

findRadius : Circle -> Float




{--
Implement the biggerCircle function. It should return a circle with twice the area.

biggerCircle : Circle -> Circle




{--
Return a function (a lambda) from the function below. The lambda should
Take one argument of type Int and return an Int twice as big

f : Int -> Int




{--
Implement the fibonacci sequence 1,1,2,3,5,8,.. which is defined by being the sum
of the two previous fibonacci numbers in the sequence, and the first two being 1
